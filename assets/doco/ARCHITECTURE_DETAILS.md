# Architecture Details

## Considerations

The following points were considered when designing the proposed architecture:

### Performance

The ability to scale both vertically on all tiers and horizontally on the web tier.   Resources should be able automatically scale vertically based unpredictable, changing workloads.

### Security

The database should not be accessible directly from the internet.   Data should be encrypted at rest and, when traversing networks, in motion.  The application tiers (ORDS Servers) should not be accssible directly from the internet.  Access to the ORDS Servers should be via a load-balancer for application and the Bastion Service for physical maintenance.

### Availability

Remove a single point of failure by introducing redundancy via Availability and Fault Domains and native ADB solutions.

### Identity

The application should be reachable using a “friendly”, organisation specific URL.

### Extensibility and Flexibility

Designed to seamlessly cater for the addition or removal of resources, capabilities and/or functionality.

## Components

The proposed architecture has the following components:

### Region

An Oracle Cloud Infrastructure region is a localized geographic area that contains one or more data centres, called availability domains.

### Availability domains

Availability domains are stand-alone, independent data centres within a region.  The physical resources in each availability domain are isolated from the resources in the other availability domains, which provides fault tolerance.

### Fault domains

A fault domain is a grouping of hardware and infrastructure within an availability domain.  Each availability domain has three fault domains with independent power and hardware.  Applications can tolerate physical server failure, system maintenance, and power failures inside a fault domain.

### Cloud Guard

Oracle Cloud Guard monitors and maintains the security of the Oracle Cloud resources.  Cloud Guard uses definable detector recipes to examine the resources for security weaknesses and to monitor operators and users for risky activities.

### Virtual cloud network (VCN), Public and Private Subnets

A VCN is a customizable, software-defined network.  Like traditional data centre networks, VCNs give complete control over the network environment.  A VCN can have multiple non-overlapping CIDR blocks which can be segmented into subnets.  A subnet can be public or private.

### Security List/Network Security Group (NSG)

For each subnet, Security Lists and/or Network Security Groups are used to specify the source, destination, and type of traffic that must be allowed in and out of the subnet.

### Load Balancer

The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Load Balancing service provides automated traffic distribution from a single entry point to one or multiple servers in the back end.  The load balancer provides a “friendly” URL and to secure web traffic (data in motion) with SSL/TLS Certificates.

### Bastion Services

The Bastion as a Service provides restricted and time-limited secure access to the ORDS Server(s) and the Autonomous Data Warehouse.  These resources do not have public endpoints and require strict resource access controls.

### ORDS Server(s)

Compute instance(s) with Oracle Autonomous Linux installed providing Oracle REST Data Services (ORDS) connectivity to the Autonomous Data Warehouse.  The ORDS Server(s) will proxy requests between a web browser and the Oracle Application Express engine.

### Autonomous Transaction Processing Database (ATP)

An Oracle autonomous database that includes Oracle Application Express (APEX) and Oracle Machine Learning (ML).  By default, Autonomous Databases are highly available, incorporating a multi-node configuration to protect against localized hardware failures that do not require fast disaster recovery.

### Application Express (APEX)

Oracle APEX Application Development is a low-code development platform which enables building scalable and secure enterprise applications.  APEX users can access models and results from Oracle Machine Learning.

### Object Storage

Object Storage offers reliable and cost-efficient data durability, it provides quick access to large amounts of structured and unstructured data of any content type, including database data, analytic data, images, videos and more. We recommend using standard storage to ingest data from external sources because applications and users can access it quickly. You can build a lifecycle policy to move the data from standard storage to archive storage when it’s no longer required to be accessed frequently.

### Oracle Integration Cloud (OIC) - Standard

OIC will allow for the storage of external data sources into the Object Storage for consumption via a RESTful API.

## Recommendations

Requirements might differ or change from the architecture proposed.  Use the following recommendations as a starting point to adjusting the architecture; changes may impact pricing:

### Dedicated Networking (Chargeable)

Access to/from an On-Premise data centre will require additional networking configuration including but not limited to FastConnect and Dynamic Routing Gateways.

### Security Zones (Free)

For resources that require maximum security, Oracle recommends to use security zones.  A security zone is a compartment associated with an Oracle-defined recipe of security policies that are based on best practices.  For example, the resources in a security zone must not be accessible from the public internet and they must be encrypted using customer-managed keys.  When creating or updating resources in a security zone, OCI validates the operations against the policies in the security-zone recipe, and denies operations that violate any of the policies.

### Web Application Firewall (Chargeable)

Web Application Firewall (WAF) protects applications from malicious and unwanted internet traffic. WAF can protect any internet facing endpoint, providing consistent rule enforcement across a customer's applications.  WAF provides the ability to create and manage rules for internet threats including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection and other OWASP-defined vulnerabilities. Unwanted bots can be mitigated while tactically allowed desirable bots to enter. Access rules can limit based on geography or the signature of the request.

### ORDS Server(s) Shape (Chargeable)

It is recommend to use a flexible VM shape for the compute instance; this will allow the increase and decrease of the VMs capacity in minutes.  Use Apache JMeter to load test functional behaviour and measure the performance.

### ATP CPU Auto-Scaling (Chargeable)

It is recommend to leave auto-scaling enabled; this will allow the increase and decrease of the databases CPU and I/O resources.  Use Apache JMeter to load test functional behaviour and measure the performance.

### Autonomous Data Guard (Chargeable)

Autonomous Data Guard monitors the primary database and if the Autonomous Database instance goes down, then the standby instance assumes the role of the primary instance adding additional fault tolerance.

### Data Catalog (Chargeable)

OCI Data Catalog is a fully managed, self-service data discovery and governance solution for your enterprise data. Data Catalog provides a single collaborative environment to manage technical, business, and operational metadata.

### Oracle Analytics Cloud (Chargeable)

Oracle Analytics Cloud empowers business analysts with modern, AI-powered, self-service analytics capabilities for data preparation, visualization, enterprise reporting, augmented analysis, and natural language processing and generation.Oracle Analytics Cloud is integrated with Oracle Machine Learning. This integration allows analysts to list available in-database models and use those models in Oracle Analytics Cloud analytics and dashboards.
